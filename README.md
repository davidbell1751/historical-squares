Savnnah Squares Historical Society WebPage Donation

Responded to the Savannah Georgia Historical Society that requested a webpage with only light detail into the savannah parks.

1.  I used the picture of the forsyth park fountain as the header as it is one of the more prominent features of all the parks
2.  I created a short description of each park beside its name.
3.  I only used HTML and CSS for this webpage as was the request at the time.
4.  I added a link to the historical society at the bottom of the page.
